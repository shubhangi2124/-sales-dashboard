# 📊 Sales Dashboard – Internet Sales Performance

## 📌 Project Overview
Steven, the Sales Manager, requested to improve their internet sales reports by switching from static formats to interactive dashboards. The goal was to analyze how much of each product was sold, to which clients, over time—and compare this against budgeted targets.

This dashboard provides interactive filtering and enables deeper insights into sales performance over a 3-year window (2019–2021).
